### Asteroids game
------------ 
#### Educational game to teach addition to kids, coded by me as a second year student for the Computer Graphics course.



Note that the quality and readability of code is low, and the game might even fry you CPU fans.   
It was coded a <b>long long long long long long long long</b> time ago ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
